# Cancellation & Refund Policy

Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them under the Terms of Use which govern your use of our website [www.swiggy.com](https://www.swiggy.com) (the “Website”) and our ‘Swiggy’ application for mobile and handheld devices (the “App”). The Website and the App are jointly referred to as the “Platform”.

## Customer Cancellation

As a general rule, the Buyer shall not be entitled to cancel an order once placed.

If the Buyer cancels his/her order after placing it, Swiggy shall have the right to charge 100% of the order amount for breach of contract terms, as compensation for the damages suffered by Swiggy. This includes the right to either:
- Not refund the order value (if the order is prepaid), or
- Recover the amount from the Buyer’s subsequent order (if the order is postpaid),  
to compensate the Merchants and Delivery Partners (PDPs).

## Non-Customer Cancellation

Swiggy reserves the right to collect a penalty for orders cancelled by Swiggy for reasons not attributable to Swiggy, including but not limited to:
- The address provided by the Buyer is either wrong or outside the delivery zone
- Failure to contact the Buyer by phone or email at the time of delivery
- Lack of information, direction, or authorization from the Buyer
- Unavailability of all ordered items

In such events, Swiggy will contact the Buyer and allow them to cancel the entire order and be entitled to a refund up to 100% of the order value.

If cancellation is due to reasons attributable to Swiggy or the Merchant or PDP, no penalty will be charged.
